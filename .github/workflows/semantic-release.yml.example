# Semantic Release Workflow (Optional)
#
# This workflow automatically determines version numbers based on commit messages
# and creates releases when code is pushed to master.
#
# Requires conventional commits:
# - feat: New feature (minor version bump)
# - fix: Bug fix (patch version bump)
# - BREAKING CHANGE: Breaking change (major version bump)
#
# To enable:
# 1. Rename this file to semantic-release.yml
# 2. Install: npm install --save-dev semantic-release @semantic-release/changelog @semantic-release/git
# 3. Add .releaserc.json configuration
# 4. Use conventional commit messages in PRs
